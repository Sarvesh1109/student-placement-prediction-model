Project:- Student Placement Prediction Model
Developed a machine learning project to predict student placement outcomes based on academic, extracurricular, and skill-based features. Implemented multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and SVM, to compare model performance. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Utilized feature importance analysis to identify key predictors like CGPA, internships, and soft skills. Achieved optimized predictions through hyperparameter tuning, ensuring robust and interpretable results. Visualized insights and performance metrics to enhance decision-making for placement strategies.
